<h4 class="texte">A balloon is an aircraft (balloon) in which a gas that is lighter than air is used for flight. It consists of a gas-filled shell and a basket or trailer cab attached to it. Unlike airships, balloons do not have engines for independent horizontal movement in the air.The first balloon in 1783 was made by the Montgolfier brothers. The balloon they created was filled with hot air, thanks to which the balloon rose up. In addition, the following gases are used in aeronautical practice: hydrogen, water gas, lamp gas, ammonia[1]Interestingly, the first balloon with a liquid fuel burner was invented by Lviv residents Ignatiy Martynovich and German Nepomuk. In 1784, a balloon without passengers with an automatic liquid fuel burner rose over the Belsky Garden in Lviv</h4>
